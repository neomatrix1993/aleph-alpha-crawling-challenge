# Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Batcher Prometheus Counters
- Added URL filtering pipeline tracking with 4 metrics:
  - `urls_total`: Total URLs processed from cluster.idx
  - `urls_filtered_language`: URLs filtered out for non-English content
  - `urls_filtered_status`: URLs filtered out for non-200 HTTP status
  - `urls_kept`: URLs that passed all filters and were queued
- Refactored filtering logic for better observability
- Metrics exposed on port 9000

### 2. Worker Prometheus Counters  
- Added comprehensive WARC processing stage tracking with 10 metrics:
  - `worker_batches`: Number of consumed batches
  - `worker_warc_files_downloaded`: WARC files successfully downloaded
  - `worker_warc_records_*`: Record-level processing stats
  - `worker_text_extractions_*`: Text extraction success/failure rates
  - `worker_download_errors`: Download failures by error type
  - `worker_documents_*`: Document processing and upload counts
- Metrics exposed on port 9002 (avoiding MinIO port conflict)

### 3. Worker Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling for network failures
- Graceful degradation: continues processing other items when individual downloads fail
- Error categorization by exception type for better debugging
- Always acknowledges RabbitMQ messages to prevent redelivery loops
- Created test suite to verify error handling behavior

### 4. Object Storage + Tokenization Pipeline
- Integrated MinIO S3-compatible object storage
- Added HuggingFace BERT tokenizer for NLP preprocessing
- Created intelligent batching system with configurable thresholds:
  - Document count: 10,000 docs
  - Size limit: 256MB
  - Time limit: 30 minutes
- Stores both full text and tokenized data in Parquet format
- Organized data by date hierarchy: `processed/YYYY/MM/DD/batch_timestamp.parquet`
- Schema includes: url, timestamp, full_text, tokens, token_count, char_count, filename

### 5. Object Store Configuration CLI Arguments ✅
- Added CLI arguments for MinIO credentials and settings
- Configurable S3 endpoint, access key, secret key, and bucket name
- Default values for localhost development environment

### 6. Data Volume Metrics ✅
- Added comprehensive data volume tracking metrics
- Track bytes downloaded, batch processing time, batch sizes
- Monitor document batch size and upload attempts/failures

### 7. Document Length Filter ✅
- Filter documents between 500-1,000,000 characters
- Prevents processing of too short or excessively long content
- Improves data quality for ML training

### 8. Configurable Crawl Version ✅
- Made CC-MAIN-2024-30 crawl version configurable via CLI argument
- Added `--crawl-version` parameter to batcher.py
- Refactored commoncrawl.py to use dynamic path generation

### 9. RabbitMQ Error Handling ✅
- Added checkpoint-based recovery system with file persistence
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 60s max)
- Created robust publisher with automatic connection recovery
- Added comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Process can resume exactly where it left off after failures
- Organized code into separate modules: checkpoint.py, health_checker.py, robust_publisher.py

### 10. Batcher Monitoring ✅
- Added exact line counting from cluster.idx file (reads last column for total: 1,021,496 lines)
- Added processing progress percentage calculation with Prometheus gauge
- Added real-time batch count tracking with `batches_published_total` metric
- Progress monitoring shows current position and completion percentage
- Metrics exposed: `batcher_progress_percent`, `batcher_total_index_lines`, `batches_published_total`
