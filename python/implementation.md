# Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Batcher Prometheus Counters
- Added URL filtering pipeline tracking with 4 metrics:
  - `urls_total`: Total URLs processed from cluster.idx
  - `urls_filtered_language`: URLs filtered out for non-English content
  - `urls_filtered_status`: URLs filtered out for non-200 HTTP status
  - `urls_kept`: URLs that passed all filters and were queued
- Refactored filtering logic for better observability
- Metrics exposed on port 9000

### 2. Worker Prometheus Counters  
- Added comprehensive WARC processing stage tracking with 10 metrics:
  - `worker_batches`: Number of consumed batches
  - `worker_warc_files_downloaded`: WARC files successfully downloaded
  - `worker_warc_records_*`: Record-level processing stats
  - `worker_text_extractions_*`: Text extraction success/failure rates
  - `worker_download_errors`: Download failures by error type
  - `worker_documents_*`: Document processing and upload counts
- Metrics exposed on port 9002 (avoiding MinIO port conflict)

### 3. Worker Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling for network failures
- Graceful degradation: continues processing other items when individual downloads fail
- Error categorization by exception type for better debugging
- Always acknowledges RabbitMQ messages to prevent redelivery loops
- Created test suite to verify error handling behavior

### 4. Object Storage + Tokenization Pipeline
- Integrated MinIO S3-compatible object storage
- Added HuggingFace BERT tokenizer for NLP preprocessing
- Created intelligent batching system with configurable thresholds:
  - Document count: 10,000 docs
  - Size limit: 256MB
  - Time limit: 30 minutes
- Stores both full text and tokenized data in Parquet format
- Organized data by date hierarchy: `processed/YYYY/MM/DD/batch_timestamp.parquet`
- Schema includes: url, timestamp, full_text, tokens, token_count, char_count, filename

## In Progress

### 5. Object Store Configuration CLI Arguments
- Making MinIO credentials and settings configurable via command line
- Currently hardcoded for localhost development

## Pending Tasks

### 6. Data Volume Metrics
- Track download volume and batch/document processing counts

### 7. Document Length Filter  
- Filter documents between 500-1,000,000 characters

### 8. Configurable Crawl Version
- Make CC-MAIN-2024-30 crawl version a CLI argument

### 9. RabbitMQ Error Handling
- Add network recovery for publishing operations

### 10. Batcher Monitoring
- Track cluster.idx processing percentage and batch counts
